Reasoning: Heat stress → dehydration (loss of water), which reduces fluid levels in body. Dehydration → electrolyte imbalance (e.g., sodium/potassium loss), disrupting cellular function. Electrolyte imbalance → neuromuscular junction impairment (nerve signals misfire), reducing motor neuron communication. Impaired neuromuscular junctions → reduced motor unit recruitment (fewer muscle fibers activated). Reduced motor unit recruitment → increased feeling of *weakness* (opposite of 'less').

Causal graph: cause -> outcome
Reasoning: {'step1': 'Decreased population growth → fewer people require resources (e.g., land, food, energy).', 'step2': 'Reduced resource demand → lower pressure to convert natural habitats into developed areas (e.g., cities, farms).', 'step3': 'Lower habitat conversion pressure → *less* habitat degradation.', 'answer': 'B'}

Causal graph: cause -> outcome
Reasoning: 1. **Cause**: Decreased Northridge earthquakes → **lowered seismic hazard exposure** in the region.
2. **Link**: Less seismic activity → **reduced threat of damage/casualties** linked to earthquakes.
3. **Outcome**: The **danger level** directly correlates with earthquake frequency, so **less danger** (Choice B).

Causal graph: radiation_exposure -> [cell_replication_errors] -> [genetic_instability] -> [less_mutations (via repair_mechanisms)]
Reasoning: Reduced radiation exposure → fewer cell replication errors → lower genetic instability (due to fewer errors triggering instability) → increased effectiveness of DNA repair mechanisms → fewer mutations overall. **Answer: B (less)**
