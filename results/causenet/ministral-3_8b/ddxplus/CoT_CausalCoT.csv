**Step 3: Mechanism**
Higher energy efficiency reduces operational costs (e.g., lower energy bills) and/or improves asset performance, making projects more attractive.

Causal graph: GHG -> Temp, Temp -> SeaLevel, GHG -> SeaLevel
*(Note: GHG directly warms the climate (Temp) and indirectly affects sea level via ice melt/thermal expansion, but also has minor direct effects like ocean acidification that may slightly reduce sea level via carbonate chemistry—though this is negligible compared to warming effects.)*

**Step 3: Mechanism**
Greenhouse gases trap heat, raising global temperatures. Higher temperatures melt glaciers/ice sheets (e.g., Greenland, Antarctica) and expand seawater via thermal expansion, both raising sea levels. While minor GHG-induced ocean acidification could *theoretically* reduce sea level by dissolving carbonate minerals (e.g., coral reefs), this effect is **far outweighed** by melting and expansion.

- *Inverse pressure changes:* If pressure *decreases* (e.g., drought conditions), floods typically *decrease* due to reduced precipitation/flow.

Causal graph: **Population_Size → Extinction_Risk**
*(Smaller population → higher extinction risk; thus, decreasing population size increases extinction risk.)*

**Step 3: Mechanism**
Smaller populations are more vulnerable to stochastic events (e.g., disease, environmental fluctuations) due to lower genetic diversity and higher susceptibility to demographic stochasticity. This increases extinction risk.

**Step 4: Choose the best option**
If population size decreases, extinction risk **increases** (not decreases). The question asks about ""less extinction,"" which is incorrect—extinction risk rises.

**Final answer:** **B** *(Wait, no—this contradicts the logic. Clarification: The question phrasing is ambiguous. If ""less extinction"" refers to *lower extinction risk*, then decreasing population size would lead to **more** extinction (not less). If ""less extinction"" means *fewer extinctions occurring*, the answer is still **B** because fewer species survive. However, the core causal link is: smaller population → higher extinction risk → more extinctions. Thus, the correct answer is **B** (more extinctions), but the options are phrased poorly. Assuming ""less extinction"" = lower risk, the answer is **B** (more risk → more extinctions). Revising: The correct interpretation is that decreasing population size **increases** extinction risk, so the outcome is **more** extinctions. The options are likely misworded. If ""less extinction"" means *fewer extinctions*, the answer is **B** (more extinctions occur). If ""less extinction"" means *lower risk*, the answer is **B** (more risk).

Higher acidity typically enhances chemical breakdown (e.g., protein denaturation, corrosion), reducing *unwanted* loss (e.g., nutrient waste) or increasing *desired* degradation (e.g., material erosion). If ""loss"" refers to *undesirable* degradation (e.g., corrosion), more acid → more loss. If ""loss"" refers to *efficient* digestion (e.g., nutrient absorption), more acid → less *unabsorbed* loss. **Context matters**, but the question likely implies *material/structural loss* (e.g., metal rusting), where acidity accelerates degradation.

Increasing artificial food sources typically reduces hunger-driven resource scarcity (e.g., less slash-and-burn farming for food). This directly lowers *destruction* (e.g., fewer cleared forests for crops).
