73,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"Here's the solution:

**Causal Graph:** Reaction → Itchiness (i.e., a decrease in reaction leads to an increase in itchiness)

**Reasoning:** If reaction decreases, it means that the body is reacting less strongly to something. This could be due to various reasons such as reduced inflammation or decreased immune response. As a result of this decrease in reaction, the sensation of itchiness might become more pronounced because the body's natural response to irritation (itchiness) is not being suppressed by a strong reaction.

74,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"Here's the solution:

**Causal Graph:** Non-native species → More harm

**Reasoning:** If non-native species increase, it is likely to lead to more harm because these species can outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystems, and potentially introduce new diseases. As a result, the presence of non-native species would cause an increase in the amount of harm.

**Causal Graph:** Solar wind → Coronal heating → Less situation (e.g. less solar activity, less aurora borealis)

**Reasoning:** If solar wind decreases, it means there is less energy and particles being emitted from the sun. This decrease in solar wind would likely lead to a decrease in coronal heating, which is the process by which the sun's corona is heated. As a result, we can expect a less intense situation, such as less solar activity or fewer aurora borealis displays.
