Reasoning: The absence of a recent viral infection disrupts the main causal chain: *virus → immune response → myocarditis*. Without viral exposure, alternative causes (e.g., autoimmune, bacterial, or idiopathic) become relatively more influential, but they are less probable overall. Thus, the probability of myocarditis decreases. → **Choice B: less**.

Reasoning: Pneumonia’s pathophysiology (e.g., inflammation, fluid accumulation) is primarily driven by pathogen load/inflammatory response—not circadian rhythms. If symptoms worsen at night, it may indicate **alternative diagnoses** (e.g., heart failure, COPD exacerbation) where nocturnal mechanics (e.g., recumbency) dominate. This specificity *lowers* the pretest probability for pneumonia, as its hallmark symptoms (fever, sputum, dyspnea) are less likely to show such strict diurnal patterns. **Answer: B (less)**
