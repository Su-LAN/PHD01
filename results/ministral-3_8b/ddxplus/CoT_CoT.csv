**Reasoning:**
Detachment (derealization/depersonalization) disrupts the patient’s sense of reality, increasing emotional instability and anxiety. This heightened emotional dysregulation directly raises the likelihood of panic attacks, not reduces it. Thus, detachment does not lower panic attack probability—it worsens it.

1,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"Causal graph: **excessive tearing → trigeminal nerve irritation → cranial autonomic symptoms → cluster headache probability**

Reasoning:
Excessive tearing (epiphora) often stems from irritation or dysfunction in the trigeminal nerve (CN V) or autonomic nervous system, which also governs cluster headache symptoms (e.g., nasal congestion, eyelid drooping). Since cluster headaches are linked to cranial autonomic dysfunction, increased tearing—an autonomic symptom—may signal heightened trigeminal-autonomic reflex activity, raising the likelihood of cluster headache attacks.

2,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** viral_infection → myocarditis

**Reasoning:**
Viral infections (e.g., COVID-19, adenovirus, or influenza) are well-established triggers for myocarditis due to immune-mediated inflammation of the heart muscle. Without a recent viral infection, the direct inflammatory pathway to myocarditis is reduced, lowering its probability. Thus, the absence of a viral trigger decreases the likelihood of myocarditis.

3,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** *vomiting_blood_or_coffee_grounds → upper_GI_bleed → GERD_symptoms*

**Reasoning:**
Vomiting blood or coffee-ground-like material (melena) strongly suggests an **upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed**, which is often caused by conditions like peptic ulcers, esophagitis, or severe GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) with complications (e.g., esophagitis-induced bleeding). While GERD itself doesn’t directly cause bleeding, severe reflux can damage the esophagus, increasing the risk of bleeding episodes. Thus, the presence of such symptoms **increases** the likelihood of underlying GERD complications (e.g., erosive esophagitis) rather than reducing it.

4,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** HIV_infection → Immune_system_suppression → Vulnerability_to_cardiovascular_disease → Risk_of_NSTEMI/STEMI

**Reasoning:**
HIV infection suppresses the immune system and increases systemic inflammation, which is linked to higher cardiovascular risk (e.g., atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction). Without HIV infection, immune suppression is absent, reducing this pathway’s contribution to myocardial infarction risk. Thus, absence of HIV infection logically lowers the probability of NSTEMI/STEMI.

5,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** patient_contact_with_Ebola_infected → probability_of_Ebola

**Reasoning:**
Direct contact with someone infected with Ebola significantly increases the likelihood of exposure and subsequent infection due to the virus's high transmissibility through bodily fluids. Answering ""YES"" to this question indicates a clear risk factor for Ebola, which should raise the probability of infection rather than reduce or have no effect.

6,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** deviated nasal septum → airflow obstruction → mucus stasis → bacterial colonization → inflammation → chronic rhinosinusitis

**Reasoning:**
A deviated nasal septum disrupts normal airflow, causing mucus to pool and stagnate in the nasal passages. This stasis increases the risk of bacterial colonization and persistent inflammation, which are key factors in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus, the presence of a deviated septum is strongly associated with a **higher** likelihood of this condition.

7,ddxplus,less,False,no effect,C,"**Causal graph:** patient_has_no_pain_with_movement → **reduces** likelihood_of_traumatic_force, **reduces** likelihood_of_muscle_spasm, **reduces** likelihood_of_rib_fracture_detection_delay → **reduces** spontaneous_rib_fracture_probability

**Reasoning:**
Spontaneous rib fractures (e.g., from osteoporosis or pathological conditions) are often painless or minimally painful, especially in early stages. If a patient lacks pain *increased by movement*, it suggests either:
1) No underlying fracture (lower probability of spontaneous fracture),
2) A fracture already present but stable (less likely to worsen due to movement),
3) A non-traumatic, painless etiology (e.g., metabolic bone disease) that may still exist independently of movement.
However, **absence of movement-increased pain is a *negative predictor*** for acute traumatic fractures (which typically cause localized pain with movement). Since spontaneous fractures are often painless or poorly localized, the lack of movement-related pain *does not necessarily rule them out*—but it does not *increase* their probability either. The most accurate interpretation is that this symptom **does not meaningfully alter** the baseline risk of spontaneous rib fracture.

**Reasoning:**
Both **loss of appetite** and **early satiation** (getting full quickly) are symptoms of **malnutrition** and **weight loss**, which are associated with **pulmonary neoplasm** (lung cancer). If these symptoms are **absent**, the likelihood of underlying malnutrition/weight loss decreases, indirectly reducing the probability of pulmonary neoplasm.

Reasoning:
Sudden cheek redness (flushing) is a classic symptom of **histamine toxicity**, which occurs in **Scombroid poisoning** due to spoiled fish (e.g., tuna, mackerel) containing high levels of histamine. Since flushing is a direct physiological response to histamine, its presence strongly correlates with the likelihood of Scombroid poisoning.

**Reasoning:**
Vomiting blood (hematemesis) or coffee-ground-like material (melena) suggests bleeding from the upper or lower GI tract, respectively. Boerhaave syndrome (esophageal rupture) typically presents with **pain, subcutaneous emphysema, and shock**, not hematemesis or melena. These symptoms are **unlikely** to occur together, so their presence actually **decreases** the probability of Boerhaave.

11,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** *No contact with pertussis case → Reduced exposure to pathogen → Lower probability of infection*

**Reasoning:**
Lack of contact with an infected individual removes the primary route of transmission (respiratory droplets/aerosols) for *Bordetella pertussis*. Without exposure, the chance of acquiring the pathogen—and thus developing whooping cough—diminishes. This is a direct causal link: fewer contacts with the pathogen → lower infection probability.

**Reasoning:**
Premature birth or complications at delivery are known risk factors for inguinal hernias due to incomplete closure of the inguinal canal or abdominal wall defects. If the patient answers **NO** to having these conditions, the direct causal risk factor is removed or reduced, lowering the probability of developing an inguinal hernia.

13,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** *vomiting_efforts → esophageal_mucosa_damage → Boerhaave_syndrome*

**Reasoning:**
Repeated vomiting or forced emetic efforts increase intrathoracic pressure, which can tear the esophageal lining (esophageal mucosa damage). This damage is a key precursor to Boerhaave syndrome (a spontaneous esophageal rupture). Thus, more vomiting efforts logically raise the risk of Boerhaave.

14,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** *uncertainty_about_death → emotional_distress → panic_attack_probability*

**Reasoning:**
Uncertainty or fear about death introduces **emotional distress** (e.g., anxiety, dread), which is a known trigger for panic attacks. If the patient lacks this fear or denial reduces their awareness of mortality, the emotional distress may decrease, lowering the likelihood of a panic attack.

15,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** chills → fever → immune response suppression → bacterial/viral proliferation → pneumonia risk

**Reasoning:**
Chills/shivers are a symptom of fever, which is often an early immune response to infection (e.g., from pathogens that cause pneumonia). While fever itself can help fight infection, severe or prolonged chills may indicate systemic inflammation or weakened immune defense, increasing susceptibility to pneumonia. Thus, their presence typically correlates with a higher risk of pneumonia progression.

16,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** patient_cholesterol_level → medication_for_cholesterol → plaque_formation_in_arteries → coronary_artery_blockage → stable_angina_probability

**Reasoning:**
High cholesterol and its untreated or inadequately treated state contribute to the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries, which increases the likelihood of artery blockage. Stable angina occurs due to reduced blood flow caused by these blockages. If cholesterol is low or actively managed with medication, plaque formation is reduced, lowering the risk of blockages and thus decreasing the probability of stable angina. Therefore, lower cholesterol or medication for it reduces the probability of stable angina.

Reasoning:
Pericarditis often presents with symptoms like palpitations, racing, or irregular heartbeats. If the patient lacks these symptoms, clinicians rely less on pericarditis as a likely diagnosis, reducing its probability. The absence of key symptoms weakens the causal link between pericarditis and the observed clinical picture.

**Reasoning:**
Vomiting after coughing may indicate irritation of the respiratory tract (e.g., due to forceful coughing or underlying infection) or dehydration, both of which can weaken the immune system. A weakened immune system increases susceptibility to infections like whooping cough (*Bordetella pertussis*). Thus, vomiting (a symptom) likely correlates with a *higher* (not lower) probability of whooping cough, not less.

patient_takes_cholesterol_medication → reduced_plaque_formation → reduced_coronary_artery_narrowing → improved_blood_flow_to_heart → reduced_stable_angina

**Reasoning:**
High cholesterol directly promotes plaque buildup in arteries, which narrows coronary arteries and restricts blood flow to the heart, increasing the likelihood of stable angina. Conversely, medications that lower cholesterol reduce plaque formation, alleviate artery narrowing, and improve blood flow, thereby decreasing the risk of stable angina. Thus, high cholesterol increases the probability of stable angina, while cholesterol medications decrease it.

**Reasoning:**
Double vision (diplopia) is a classic symptom of ocular muscle weakness, which often stems from impaired neuromuscular transmission at the junction between nerves and muscles. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder that specifically targets these junctions, weakening muscle control. If a patient lacks double vision, it suggests either milder or absent ocular muscle dysfunction, which reduces the likelihood of MG-related neuromuscular junction involvement. Thus, the absence of double vision correlates with a *lower* probability of MG.

21,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"Causal graph: **symptoms (fatigue, discomfort, muscle aches, general well-being change) → probability of Chagas diagnosis**

Reasoning:
Chagas disease (caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi*) often presents with **non-specific symptoms** like fatigue, muscle aches, and general malaise—especially in the **chronic indeterminate phase** (which can last decades). These symptoms are **highly overlapping** with other infections, autoimmune conditions, or even stress/depression. Since Chagas is **not the only cause** of these vague complaints, their presence **does not increase** the likelihood of a Chagas diagnosis but rather **decreases specificity** (i.e., they could stem from countless other conditions). Thus, these symptoms **reduce the probability of Chagas** when considered in isolation from other diagnostic clues (e.g., serology, travel history, vector exposure).

22,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** osteoporosis_treatment → bone_strength, bone_strength → fracture_probability

**Reasoning:**
Osteoporosis weakens bones by reducing bone density and strength. Without treatment, bone strength declines further, increasing the likelihood of fractures (including spontaneous rib fractures). Thus, untreated osteoporosis raises fracture probability, meaning *less* treatment reduces the chance of spontaneous fractures becoming less likely (i.e., the condition worsens, making fractures more probable). The question asks about the *less probability* of spontaneous rib fracture—since untreated osteoporosis increases fracture risk, the probability of *not* having a spontaneous fracture decreases (i.e., the likelihood of fractures *increases*).

**Reasoning:**
Viral pharyngitis is typically transmitted through close contact with infected individuals. If the patient has not been in contact with someone with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, the likelihood of exposure to the virus is significantly lower. This reduces the probability that their symptoms are due to viral pharyngitis, as the primary mode of transmission is person-to-person contact.

**Reasoning:**
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is a known trigger for laryngospasm due to acid exposure and irritation of the throat/larynx. If a patient has never been diagnosed with GERD, the likelihood of GERD-related triggers (e.g., acid reflux episodes) is inherently lower. This reduces the risk of laryngospasm caused by GERD, assuming other potential causes remain constant.

Reasoning:
A family history of croup (or lack thereof) influences genetic/immune factors that may predispose an individual to recurrent or severe respiratory infections like croup. Without prior exposure or family history, the baseline susceptibility to croup is generally lower, reducing the probability of the child developing it.

**Reasoning:**
A non-deviated nasal septum improves nasal airflow and sinus drainage, reducing mucus stagnation and inflammation. Better drainage lowers the risk of bacterial/fungal buildup, which is a key driver of chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus, absence of septal deviation *decreases* the likelihood of developing the condition.

27,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** patient_voice_change → patient_awareness_of_change → diagnosis_confidence → epiglottitis_probability

**Reasoning:**
Epiglottitis is a severe infection that often causes noticeable changes in voice (deeper, softer, or hoarse tone) due to inflammation or obstruction. If the patient is unaware of these voice changes, it reduces the likelihood that a clinician will suspect epiglottitis during assessment. Lower diagnosis confidence typically leads to fewer diagnostic tests or misdiagnosis, indirectly reducing the probability of correctly identifying epiglottitis. Thus, unawareness of voice changes lowers the probability of accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, indirectly affecting the perceived probability of epiglottitis.

Secondhand smoke contains carcinogens (e.g., benzene, formaldehyde) that directly damage lung tissue, increasing oxidative stress and mutational risk. Removing this exposure reduces chronic inflammation and DNA mutations, lowering the probability of neoplastic transformation in lung cells. Thus, reduced exposure logically decreases the likelihood of pulmonary neoplasm.

**Reasoning:**
A prior depression diagnosis often indicates an increased baseline vulnerability to other psychiatric disorders due to shared neurobiological and psychological mechanisms (e.g., dysregulation in serotonin, cognitive biases, or stress reactivity). Additionally, depression frequently co-occurs with anxiety disorders, which are strongly linked to panic attacks.

Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) with a sensation of discomfort or blockage often indicates **mechanical obstruction or inflammation** in the throat/upper airway. Epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis) is a severe infection causing **swallowing difficulties, fever, and respiratory distress**. Since dysphallowing symptoms are a **key clinical feature of epiglottitis**, their presence **increases** (not decreases) the likelihood of the condition.

A history of stroke often overlaps with shared risk factors for pneumonia (e.g., age, comorbidities like diabetes/hypertension, smoking, or weakened immune function). If a patient has *never* had a stroke, they are less likely to carry these overlapping risk factors, which could reduce their baseline pneumonia susceptibility. Thus, the absence of prior stroke may correlate with a *lower* probability of pneumonia.

Inguinal hernias often cause or are associated with abdominal discomfort or visible distension due to the protrusion of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal. If the patient does **not** feel abdominal bloating or distension, this suggests a lower likelihood of internal pressure or structural issues (e.g., hernia) contributing to these symptoms.

**Reasoning:**
Absence of pain on deep inspiration suggests reduced pleural irritation or friction (e.g., no pleural inflammation, no lung overdistension, or no underlying bleb/rupture). Since spontaneous pneumothorax often stems from bleb rupture or visceral pleural irritation (triggered by coughing, deep breaths, or inflammation), mitigating these factors logically lowers its probability.

Excess saliva production can indicate irritation or inflammation in the throat/pharynx (e.g., due to infection, reflux, or allergies). This irritation increases the risk of bacterial colonization and inflammation of the epiglottis, which is a hallmark of epiglottitis.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is strongly linked to underlying structural or functional abnormalities in the heart (e.g., valves, chambers, or conduction pathways). If a patient lacks a *known* heart defect, the absence of diagnosed abnormalities reduces the likelihood of undiagnosed but clinically significant pathology that could trigger AF.

**Reasoning:**
Living in a big city is associated with higher air pollution (e.g., particulate matter, allergens), which can trigger bronchospasm and asthma exacerbations. Urban areas also offer better access to emergency care and specialized healthcare, reducing delays in treatment and improving adherence to asthma management plans. However, the *lack* of access to timely care and higher pollution exposure in big cities *increases* the risk of acute exacerbations. Conversely, patients in smaller cities/rural areas face **less pollution exposure** and **potentially delayed care**, but the dominant effect is the **reduced environmental triggers** (e.g., fewer allergens, cleaner air), which *decreases* the likelihood of bronchospasm/exacerbations. Thus, living outside a big city likely reduces the risk.

Pain on deep inspiration typically suggests pleural irritation or inflammation (e.g., pleural friction), which can indicate underlying pleural injury or irritation. Pleural injury increases the risk of pneumothorax (collapsed lung) by disrupting the lung surface or causing air leakage. Thus, **increased pain on inspiration** logically correlates with a **higher** (not lower) probability of spontaneous pneumothorax.

Tongue control difficulties (e.g., inability to keep the tongue in the mouth) are a classic **early sign of acute dystonic reactions** (ADRs), which involve involuntary muscle contractions, including those affecting facial and tongue muscles. If a patient has **no trouble keeping their tongue in their mouth**, this suggests **less muscle rigidity and fewer dystonic symptoms**, reducing the likelihood of ADRs.

Living with fewer people (≤3) likely reduces social interaction and exposure to respiratory infections (e.g., fewer shared spaces, less crowding). Lower stress from smaller households may also support better immune function. Both factors (reduced exposure + stronger immunity) would decrease the likelihood of acute laryngitis.

**Reasoning:**
Nasal polyps physically obstruct nasal passages, reducing airflow and trapping mucus, which creates stagnation (mucus_stasis).

Reasoning:
Asian populations exhibit higher prevalence of genetic variants linked to bronchiectasis (e.g., *CFTR* mutations in East Asians or *IL-10* promoter polymorphisms in Southeast Asians), which impair lung defense mechanisms. These genetic factors elevate susceptibility to recurrent infections and chronic inflammation, key drivers of bronchiectasis.

A prior sexually transmitted infection (STI) can alter immune system responses (e.g., inflammation, antibody production, or mucosal barrier damage), which may either *increase* or *decrease* susceptibility to HIV depending on the specific STI and immune dynamics. However, studies suggest that certain STIs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, chlamydia) are associated with *higher* HIV acquisition risk due to immune activation and genital ulceration, while others (e.g., HPV) may have neutral or context-dependent effects.

**Reasoning:**
Excessive alcohol consumption (especially binge drinking) damages gastric mucosal integrity, increasing the risk of esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) due to vomiting-induced pressure. Alcohol addiction exacerbates this risk by promoting chronic inflammation, impaired esophageal motility, and delayed gastric emptying—all contributing to higher Boerhaave probability.

**Reasoning:**
Symptoms worsened by exertion and relieved by rest suggest **mechanical irritation or pressure changes** in the lung (e.g., pleural friction, small blebs). This pattern is classic for **tension or secondary pneumothorax** (e.g., due to bleb rupture or lung overinflation during exertion).

**Reasoning:**
COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung condition that increases susceptibility to acute bronchitis due to shared risk factors (e.g., smoking, pollution) and damaged airway defenses. Removing COPD as a risk factor logically reduces the baseline probability of developing bronchitis, assuming other confounders remain constant.

**Reasoning:**
Boerhaave syndrome (esophageal rupture) typically occurs due to severe vomiting or retching, which increases intrathoracic pressure and tears the esophageal wall. If the patient has **not** vomited repeatedly or made forceful efforts to vomit, the mechanical stress on the esophagus is reduced.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, leading to chronic lung damage and inflammation—both key risk factors for bronchiectasis. If a patient does *not* have CF, the absence of this primary cause reduces the likelihood of the downstream lung damage and inflammation that contribute to bronchiectasis.

If the patient does not perceive muscle spasms or neck soreness as impairing head rotation, this suggests either:
1) The symptoms are mild or absent, or
2) The patient is less sensitive to them.
Either way, symptom severity is reduced, which typically decreases the likelihood of acute dystonic reactions (ADRs) being misdiagnosed or overinterpreted as a neurological emergency.

Scombroid poisoning (caused by spoiled fish) primarily affects the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, not the respiratory system. Wheezing is a respiratory symptom unrelated to the core symptoms of scombroid poisoning (e.g., flushing, headache, diarrhea).

Scombroid poisoning is caused by histamine or other biogenic amines from spoiled fish (e.g., tuna, mackerel), not directly by gut motility or stool frequency. Diarrhea may *temporarily* reduce toxin absorption by accelerating transit, but it also increases dehydration, which can *promote* bacterial growth in the gut (e.g., *Morganella* or *Proteus*) that produce histamine.

High blood pressure (hypertension) is often associated with chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation. While hypertension itself does not directly cause SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), the systemic inflammation and immune activation linked to hypertension may paradoxically *reduce* the likelihood of developing SLE in some cases. SLE is an autoimmune disease driven by excessive immune overactivity, and conditions like hypertension (often linked to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction) may create a different immune environment that is less conducive to SLE pathogenesis.

Involuntary weight loss is a **red flag symptom** for pancreatic neoplasm due to its association with advanced malignancy (e.g., pancreatic cancer often causes cachexia via metabolic dysregulation, tumor-induced anorexia, or malabsorption). As involuntary weight loss increases, it raises clinical suspicion (diagnostic_suspicion) and metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyperglycemia, malnourishment), both of which **increase** the likelihood of pancreatic neoplasm being considered in differential diagnoses. Thus, more weight loss → higher probability of suspicion → higher probability of pancreatic neoplasm.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is strongly linked to structural or functional abnormalities in heart valves (e.g., mitral or aortic valve disease), which disrupt normal blood flow and electrical conduction. If a patient lacks known valve issues, the absence of these mechanical/functional triggers reduces the likelihood of AF development or recurrence.

**Reasoning:**
Pale stools (acholia) and dark urine (hematuria/bilirubinuria) are classic signs of biliary obstruction, often caused by pancreatic head tumors compressing the bile duct. Their absence reduces the likelihood of obstruction-related symptoms, which are strong indirect indicators of pancreatic neoplasm.

**Reasoning:**
Regular exercise (4+ times/week) improves cardiovascular fitness, lowers blood pressure, and reduces LDL cholesterol, all of which reduce plaque buildup and arterial stiffness. These physiological changes enhance endothelial function and coronary artery dilation, improving blood flow to the heart.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease primarily affecting organs like the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin—not the reproductive tract. Vaginal discharge typically stems from gynecological causes (e.g., infections, inflammation), which could mask or mimic systemic symptoms.

**Reasoning:**
Irritability and mood instability are often linked to stress, immune response, or behavioral factors (e.g., frequent ear rubbing, sleep disruption). While acute otitis media (AOM) is primarily caused by bacterial/viral infections, psychological stress (reflected in irritability/mood instability) may indirectly reduce immune resilience or increase ear-related behaviors (e.g., scratching), *slightly* lowering the baseline probability of AOM in some cases. However, the direct causal link is weak, and the effect is minor compared to infectious or anatomical risk factors. Thus, **reduced irritability/stable mood** has a negligible but *theoretically* **slightly positive** (protective) effect on AOM probability—though this is not a primary factor.

**Final answer:** **A** *(more probability of AOM if irritability/mood instability is present; thus, *less* irritability/stability would correlate with *less* probability of AOM—**but the question phrasing is ambiguous**. Clarification: If the patient is *not more irritable* (i.e., irritability is lower), this would likely **reduce** AOM probability, so the answer is **B** if interpreted as ""less irritability → less AOM probability.""

**Reasoning:**
Parkinson’s disease increases pneumonia risk via multiple pathways (e.g., aspiration, immobility, or weakened immune response).

Secondhand smoke contains toxins (e.g., nicotine, tar) that irritate the upper respiratory tract, weakening mucosal defenses. Chronic irritation suppresses immune responses, increasing vulnerability to upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Thus, exposure *reduces* the probability of *resistance* to URTI, meaning the likelihood of *contracting* URTI *increases*—but the question asks about the *probability of URTI* (i.e., susceptibility), which is *higher* due to impaired defenses. However, the phrasing ""less probability of URTI"" is ambiguous: if interpreted as *resistance* (i.e., lower immunity), then exposure *reduces* resistance (i.e., *less* probability of *not* getting URTI). The most direct interpretation is that exposure *lowers* the body’s ability to avoid URTI, so the ""probability of URTI"" (risk) *increases*—but since the question asks for ""less probability,"" the answer aligns with **B: less** (i.e., the *protective* probability is diminished).

Acute dystonic reactions (ADRs) are a type of extrapyramidal symptom often characterized by **involuntary muscle contractions**, including **spasms** (e.g., oculogyric crisis, torticollis, orofacial dyskinesia). The absence of muscle spasms in the face, neck, or body suggests a **lower likelihood** of ADRs, as these symptoms are hallmark manifestations of the condition.

*(Note: Both weight loss and appetite loss are linked to malnutrition, which weakens immunity, potentially altering Chagas disease progression or diagnosis likelihood.)*

**Reasoning:**
Unintentional weight loss and loss of appetite often indicate malnutrition or systemic illness (e.g., infections, cancers, or autoimmune disorders). Malnutrition weakens the immune system, which may *increase* susceptibility to *Trypanosoma cruzi* (the parasite causing Chagas) or alter diagnostic test accuracy (e.g., lower parasitemia levels). However, Chagas disease itself can also cause weight loss/appetite loss as symptoms. Here, the question focuses on *predictive probability* of Chagas given these symptoms: **weight loss/appetite loss are more commonly associated with advanced disease or immune compromise**, which *indirectly* suggests a *higher* likelihood of Chagas (or other severe conditions). But strictly for Chagas *diagnosis probability* (e.g., via serology), malnutrition might lower detectable antibody levels, complicating detection. The question likely refers to **clinical suspicion** (symptoms pointing toward Chagas), where weight loss/appetite loss are *red flags* for higher probability.

Primary amenorrhea (no menstruation by age 12) often indicates delayed puberty, which may correlate with lower estrogen exposure and incomplete immune system maturation. SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) risk is influenced by hormonal and immune factors, and delayed puberty/menarche has been associated with a *lower* likelihood of autoimmune diseases in some studies.

**Reasoning:**
A history of fluid in the lungs (e.g., from prior pulmonary edema or heart failure) often causes structural or functional changes like fibrosis or stiffness in lung tissue. These changes reduce pulmonary compliance (the lung’s ability to expand and recoil), making it harder for the lungs to handle fluid accumulation during future episodes.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is characterized by progressive weakness/paralysis due to immune-mediated demyelination of peripheral nerves. If a patient already has weakness/paralysis in limbs or facial muscles, this is a **core symptom of GBS**, not a risk factor.

patient_has_rheumatoid_arthritis → **shared_risk_factors** (e.g., smoking, autoimmune dysfunction, chronic inflammation) → **bronchiectasis_probability**
patient_has_rheumatoid_arthritis ← **genetic_vulnerability** (e.g., HLA-DRB1 shared with bronchiectasis)
**shared_risk_factors** ← **genetic_vulnerability**

---
**Reasoning:**
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and bronchiectasis share risk factors like chronic inflammation, smoking, and genetic predispositions (e.g., HLA-DRB1 alleles). While RA itself is not a direct cause of bronchiectasis, its presence often overlaps with these shared vulnerabilities, *increasing* the baseline risk of bronchiectasis. Thus, **lacking RA** would reduce exposure to these indirect risk pathways, lowering bronchiectasis probability.

**Reasoning:**
Heart failure is a primary cause of acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload and impaired cardiac function. If heart failure is absent, the risk of acute pulmonary edema decreases because the underlying mechanism driving fluid accumulation in the lungs is removed.

194,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** sore_throat → URTI

**Reasoning:**
A sore throat is a common symptom of **upper respiratory tract infections (URTI)**, such as the common cold or flu. Since URTIs often cause inflammation and irritation in the throat, the presence of a sore throat strongly suggests an active URTI. Thus, a sore throat increases the likelihood of having an URTI rather than reducing or having no effect on it.

195,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** *Symptoms_worsen_on_lie_down → Pericarditis_probability, Symptoms_improve_on_sitting_up → Pericarditis_probability*

**Reasoning:**
Pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium) often causes **pleuritic chest pain** that worsens with **inspiration, lying flat, or deep breathing** due to friction between the inflamed layers. If symptoms **improve when sitting up** (reducing pericardial friction) and **do not worsen in supine position**, this pattern is **less consistent** with pericarditis. It may suggest alternative diagnoses (e.g., musculoskeletal pain, GERD, or non-cardiac causes). Thus, the probability of pericarditis is **lower** in this scenario.

**Reasoning:**
Allergies (hay fever, eczema) in close family members suggest a **genetic predisposition** to immune system hypersensitivity. This heightened sensitivity increases the likelihood of developing **allergic sinusitis** due to shared inflammatory pathways. Thus, a family history of allergies raises the probability of allergic sinusitis.

197,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** patient_feeling_confused_or_disorientated → **probability_of_Ebola**

**Reasoning:**
Confusion or disorientation are common neurological symptoms of Ebola infection due to viral invasion of the central nervous system. If the patient lacks these symptoms, it suggests a lower likelihood of Ebola (or another severe neurological condition). Thus, the absence of confusion/disorientation reduces the probability of Ebola.

**Reasoning:**
Acute laryngitis is often triggered or exacerbated by viral infections (e.g., colds) that cause pharyngeal inflammation and irritation of the vocal cords. If the patient has not had a cold in the last 2 weeks, the likelihood of recent viral-induced inflammation is lower, directly reducing the risk of acute laryngitis. This forms a clear causal chain from absence of cold → less irritation → lower probability of the condition.

199,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** patient_has_pain → **symptom_severity** → **diagnostic_confidence** → **Boerhaave_probability**

**Reasoning:**
Boerhaave syndrome (esophageal perforation) typically presents with severe, sudden chest/upper abdominal pain (often radiating to the back), often after vomiting or retching. If the patient lacks this classic pain symptom—especially when consulting for suspected Boerhaave—it strongly suggests the condition is **unlikely**. Absence of pain reduces symptom severity, lowers diagnostic confidence, and thus decreases the probability of Boerhaave.

200,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** nucleotides → base_pairs (A-T/G-C), base_pairs → pairing_count

**Reasoning:**
More nucleotides increase the total number of possible base pairs (A-T/G-C), but if the question specifies *less* A-T and G-C pairing specifically, this implies a shift in pairing dynamics (e.g., mismatches or alternative bonds). Thus, an increase in nucleotides could lead to fewer traditional A-T/G-C pairings if resources (e.g., complementary bases) are constrained or misaligned. This aligns with a reduction in conventional pairing.

201,ddxplus,less,False,more,A,"**Causal graph:** more bees alive → more pollination → more flowers survive/reproduce → fewer flowers die → **more flowers in environment**

**Reasoning:**
More bees alive directly increases pollination, which helps flowers reproduce and survive. This would logically lead to an *increase* in the number of flowers in the environment, not fewer. The presence of more bees counteracts the initial condition of ""less flowers"" by enhancing their growth and survival.

202,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** weaker heat source → temperature ↓ → molecular kinetic energy ↓ → molecular motion speed ↓

**Reasoning:**
A weaker heat source reduces the thermal energy available to molecules. Lower thermal energy directly decreases the average kinetic energy of the molecules, causing them to move more slowly. Thus, the effect of a weaker heat source is a reduction in molecular motion speed.

203,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"Causal graph: **global_warming → less_rain → less_crops**

Reasoning:
Global warming reduces rainfall (drought), which directly harms plant growth and agricultural productivity. Since crops rely on adequate water, less rain leads to fewer crops. Thus, the effect cascades logically from cause to outcome.

204,ddxplus,more,True,more,A,"**Causal graph:** algae_growth → fish_food_availability → fish_population

**Reasoning:**
More algae growth directly increases the availability of food for fish, as algae serve as a primary food source. With greater food availability, fish are better nourished, have higher survival rates, and can reproduce more successfully, leading to an increase in the fish population. There are no indications of limiting factors (e.g., predators, habitat loss) overriding this effect in this scenario.

205,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** more tadpoles → more resources competition → fewer surviving tadpoles → fewer young frogs

**Reasoning:**
If more tadpoles hatch, they will compete for limited resources (food, space, etc.). Increased competition likely reduces survival rates, meaning fewer tadpoles will successfully metamorphose into young frogs. Thus, the outcome is a decrease in young frogs despite the initial increase in tadpoles.

206,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** *plate_adjustment → crustal_stress → mountain_formation, crustal_stress → erosion_rate*

**Reasoning:**
If Earth’s tectonic plates adjust without violent collisions (e.g., fewer earthquakes or subduction), crustal stress decreases. Lower stress reduces uplift forces (less mountain-building) but may also slow erosion (e.g., less seismic activity to destabilize peaks). However, the primary effect is diminished tectonic uplift, which dominates over minor erosion changes. Thus, mountains would likely *shrink* over time due to reduced formation and slower replenishment.

207,ddxplus,more,False,less,B,"**Causal graph:** magma_absence → tectonic_plate_movement, magma_absence → volcanic_activity, magma_absence → heat_loss_earth, heat_loss_earth → crust_stability, tectonic_plate_movement → crust_stability

**Reasoning:**
Magma under Earth’s surface drives tectonic plate movement (via convection currents) and volcanic activity, which both contribute to crustal instability. Without magma, these processes would weaken or halt, reducing heat-driven motion and volcanic stress. The crust would likely become more stable as internal forces dissipate over time, but the absence of magma also accelerates heat loss, potentially causing long-term cooling and contraction—though this effect is secondary to the immediate stabilization of plate dynamics.

209,ddxplus,less,True,less,B,"**Causal graph:** less water condensation → less water vapor in atmosphere → weaker precipitation → less water returns to land/ocean → weaker evaporation → weaker water cycle

**Reasoning:**
If less water condenses, there is less water vapor available in the atmosphere to form clouds and precipitation. This reduces the overall amount of water returning to land and oceans, weakening the evaporation process that fuels the water cycle. A weaker evaporation rate means less moisture is reintroduced into the atmosphere, further reducing the intensity of the water cycle.

**Reasoning:**
The correct ratio of fertilizer provides optimal nutrients for plant growth, which directly supports higher crop yield. If the ratio is too low, plants may lack essential nutrients, leading to stunted growth and reduced harvests. Thus, applying the correct ratio should **increase** crop yield rather than decrease or leave it unchanged.

**Reasoning:**
If pollen sticks to a flower (e.g., on its stigma or petals), it is no longer available to pollinate other flowers. This reduces the total pollen supply, directly lowering the likelihood of successful cross-pollination for remaining flowers. Thus, fewer flowers get pollinated.
