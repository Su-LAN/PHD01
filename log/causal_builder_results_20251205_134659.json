In each pathway, higher electricity prices are a mediating factor resulting from the increased demand. The first path suggests that higher electricity prices lead individuals to use gas heating, which then impacts water heating. The second path indicates that higher electricity prices reduce hot water usage, ultimately affecting water heating. Finally, the third path proposes a direct causal link between higher electricity prices and water heating."
