In this process , the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed , reducing biodiversity . Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting natural resources for industrial production and urbanization . Clearing habitats for agriculture is the principal cause of habitat destruction . Other important causes of habitat destruction include mining , logging , trawling and urban sprawl . Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species extinction worldwide . It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by habitat fragmentation , geological processes , climate change or by human activities such as the introduction of invasive species , ecosystem nutrient depletion , and other human activities . </P> <P> The terms habitat loss and habitat reduction are also used in a wider sense , including loss of habitat from other factors , such as water and noise pollution . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Impacts on organisms </Li> <Li> 2 Geography </Li> <Li> 3 Ecosystems </Li> <Li> 4 Natural causes </Li> <Li> 5 Human causes <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Global warming </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Drivers </Li> <Li> 7 Impact on human population </Li> <Li> 8 Outlook </Li> <Li> 9 Solutions </Li> <Li> 10 Notes </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Impacts on organisms ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the simplest term , when a habitat is destroyed , the plants , animals , and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and extinction becomes more likely . Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss . Temple ( 1986 ) found that 82 % of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss . Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss , and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat . Endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction , mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world and thus , have less chance of recovering . Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem , resulting in their extinction . Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat , a phenomenon known as extinction debt . Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations . This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths , as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population , or different species . One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China \\'s giant panda , once found across the nation . Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country , as a result of widespread deforestation in the 20th century . </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> Satellite photograph of deforestation in Bolivia . Originally dry tropical forest , the land is being cleared for soybean cultivation . <P> Biodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and , when all hotspots are combined , may contain over half of the world \\'s terrestrial species . These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction . Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed ( WRI , 2003 ) . Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include New Zealand , Madagascar , the Philippines , and Japan . South and East Asia -- especially China , India , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Japan -- and many areas in West Africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat . Marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat . These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa , northern coasts of South America , and the Caribbean Sea and its associated islands . </P> <P> Regions of un sustainable agriculture or unstable governments , which may go hand - in - hand , typically experience high rates of habitat destruction . Central America , Sub-Saharan Africa , and the Amazonian tropical rainforest areas of South America are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and / or government mismanagement . </P> <P> Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction . In the U.S. , less than 25 % of native vegetation remains in many parts of the East and Midwest . Only 15 % of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe . </P> <H2> Ecosystems ( edit ) </H2> Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico <P> Tropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat . From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide , less than 9 million square kilometers remain today . The current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year , which equates to a loss of approximately 1 % of original forest habitat each year . </P> <P> Other forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests . Farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94 % of temperate broadleaf forests ; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98 % of their previous area because of human activities . Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests ; consequently , less than 0.1 % of dry forests in Central America \\'s Pacific Coast and less than 8 % in Madagascar remain from their original extents . </P> Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ( Kerinci Seblat National Park ) , Sumatra . <P> Plains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent . Only 10 - 20 % of the world \\'s drylands , which include temperate grasslands , savannas , and shrublands , scrub , and deciduous forests , have been somewhat degraded . But included in that 10 - 20 % of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry - lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification . The tallgrass prairies of North America , on the other hand , have less than 3 % of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland . </P> <P> Wetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction . More than 50 % of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years . Between 60 % and 70 % of European wetlands have been completely destroyed . In the United Kingdom , there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years . The rising sea levels and temperatures has caused soil erosion , coastal flooding , and loss of quality in the UK marine ecosystem . About one - fifth ( 20 % ) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans . One - fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed , and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing , pollution , and invasive species ; 90 % of the Philippines \\' coral reefs alone have been destroyed . Finally , over 35 % mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed . </P> <H2> Natural causes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism , fire , and climate change is well documented in the fossil record . One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity , but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles . </P> <H2> Human causes ( edit ) </H2> Deforestation and roads in Amazonia , the Amazon Rainforest . <P> Habitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests , etc. to arable land , urban sprawl , infrastructure development , and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land . Habitat degradation , fragmentation , and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat , yet result in habitat collapse . Desertification , deforestation , and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ( deserts , forests , coral reefs ) . </P> <P> Geist and Lambin ( 2002 ) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation . Their results , yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor , provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant . The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion ( 96 % ) , infrastructure expansion ( 72 % ) , and wood extraction ( 67 % ) . Therefore , according to this study , forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation . The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation : transport extension ( 64 % ) , commercial wood extraction ( 52 % ) , permanent cultivation ( 48 % ) , cattle ranching ( 46 % ) , shifting ( slash and burn ) cultivation ( 41 % ) , subsistence agriculture ( 40 % ) , and fuel wood extraction for domestic use ( 28 % ) . One result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions , while transport extension ( including the construction of new roads ) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation . </P> <H3> Global warming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rising global temperatures , caused by the greenhouse effect , contribute to habitat destruction , endangering various species , such as the polar bear . Melting ice caps promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally . </P> <H2> Drivers ( edit ) </H2> Nanjing Road in Shanghai <P> While the above - mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat , this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat . The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as drivers of habitat destruction . Demographic , economic , sociopolitical , scientific and technological , and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction . </P> <P> Demographic drivers include the expanding human population ; rate of population increase over time ; spatial distribution of people in a given area ( urban versus rural ) , ecosystem type , and country ; and the combined effects of poverty , age , family planning , gender , and education status of people in certain areas . Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots . This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9 % of the variation in numbers of threatened species across 114 countries , providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity . The boom in human population and migration of people into such species - rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests . The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people , most of whom lacking an education and family planning . </P> <P> From the Geist and Lambin ( 2002 ) study described in the previous section , the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows ( with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in ) : economic factors ( 81 % ) , institutional or policy factors ( 78 % ) , technological factors ( 70 % ) , cultural or socio - political factors ( 66 % ) , and demographic factors ( 61 % ) . The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets ( 68 % ) , which are driven by national and international demands ; urban industrial growth ( 38 % ) ; low domestic costs for land , labor , fuel , and timber ( 32 % ) ; and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops ( 25 % ) . Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development ( 40 % ) , economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement ( 34 % ) , and subsidies for land - based activities ( 26 % ) ; property rights and land - tenure insecurity ( 44 % ) ; and policy failures such as corruption , lawlessness , or mismanagement ( 42 % ) . The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry ( 45 % ) , which leads to wasteful logging practices . Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values ( 63 % ) , individual / household behavior ( 53 % ) , public unconcern toward forest environments ( 43 % ) , missing basic values ( 36 % ) , and unconcern by individuals ( 32 % ) . Demographic factors were the in - migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas ( 38 % ) and growing population density -- a result of the first factor -- in those areas ( 25 % ) . </P> <P> There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process . Road construction has the largest feedback effect , because it interacts with -- and leads to -- the establishment of new settlements and more people , which causes a growth in wood ( logging ) and food markets . Growth in these markets , in turn , progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries . When these industries become commercialized , they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often are worse on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods . Either way , more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets . This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other . </P> <H2> Impact on human population ( edit ) </H2> The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans , Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . <P> Habitat destruction vastly increases an area \\'s vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought , crop failure , spread of disease , and water contamination . On the other hand , a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening , or will at least mitigate adverse impacts . </P> <P> Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape . Over the past 50 years , the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40 % of agricultural land worldwide via erosion , salinization , compaction , nutrient depletion , pollution , and urbanization . Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed . Aesthetic uses such as birdwatching , recreational uses like hunting and fishing , and ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat . Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide . </P> <P> Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services . Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur , and carbon cycles , which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain , algal blooms , and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change . One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming more realized is climate regulation . On a local scale , trees provide windbreaks and shade ; on a regional scale , plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall ; on a global scale , plants ( especially trees from tropical rainforests ) from around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis . Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management , nitrogen fixation , oxygen production , pollination ( see pollinator decline ) , waste treatment ( i.e. , the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants ) , and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff . </P> <P> The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth \\'s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide . These services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change . </P> <P> The loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans , but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous . When biodiversity is lost , the environment loses many species that provide valuable and unique roles to the ecosystem . The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions . When too much biodiversity is lost , a catastrophic event such as an earthquake , flood , or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash , and humans would obviously suffer from that . Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher - yielding crop varieties , pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer , and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide - resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi , viruses , and bacteria . </P> <P> The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations . Across the globe , poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed , because less natural habitat means less natural resources per capita , yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources . </P> <P> Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of keeping an area undisturbed . In other words , what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat ? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row - crop agriculture , but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water , timber , ecotourism , or flood regulation and drought control . </P> <H2> Outlook ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the world \\'s food requirement substantially . Simple logic instructs that more people will require more food . In fact , as the world \\'s population increases dramatically , agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50 % , over the next 30 years . In the past , continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to appease the global food demand . That easy fix will no longer be available , however , as more than 98 % of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair . </P> <P> The impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction . Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land , so they will use more fertilizers and less concern for the environment to meet the market demand . Others will seek out new land or will convert other land - uses to agriculture . Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants . Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation , degradation , or pollution . Any efforts to protect the world \\'s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans \\' growing demand for natural resources , especially new agricultural lands . </P> <H2> Solutions ( edit ) </H2> Chelonia mydas on a Hawaiian coral reef . Although the endangered species is protected , habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of green turtle nesting beaches . <P> In most cases of tropical deforestation , three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes . This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country . Before any local , national , or international deforestation policies are written and enforced , governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country . This concept , along with many other results about tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study , can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general . Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces , rather than merely regulating the proximate causes . In a broader sense , governmental bodies at a local , national , and international scale need to emphasize the following : </P> <Ol> <Li> Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats . </Li> <Li> Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat . </Li> <Li> Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity . </Li> <Li> Developing family planning programs in areas of rapid population growth . </Li> <Li> Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production . </Li> <Li> Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats . </Li> <Li> Reduce human population and expansion . </Li> </Ol> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Sahney , S. , Benton , M.J. & Falcon - Lang , H.J.

in - hand , typically experience high rates of habitat destruction . central america , sub-saharan africa , and the amazonian tropical rainforest areas of south america are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and / or government mismanagement . </p> <p> areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction . in the u.s. , less than 25 % of native vegetation remains in many parts of the east and midwest . only 15 % of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of europe . </p> <h2> ecosystems ( edit ) </h2> jungle burned for agriculture in southern mexico <p> tropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat . from the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide , less than 9 million square kilometers remain today . the current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year , which equates to a loss of approximately 1 % of original forest habitat each year . </p> <p> other forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests . farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94 % of temperate broadleaf forests ; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98 % of their previous area because of human activities . tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests ; consequently , less than 0.1 % of dry forests in central america \\'s pacific coast and less than 8 % in madagascar remain from their original extents . </p> farmers near newly cleared land within taman nasional kerinci seblat ( kerinci seblat national park ) , sumatra . <p> plains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent . only 10 - 20 % of the world \\'s drylands , which include temperate grasslands , savannas , and shrublands , scrub , and deciduous forests , have been somewhat degraded . but included in that 10 - 20 % of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry - lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification . the tallgrass prairies of north america , on the other hand , have less than 3 % of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland . </p> <p> wetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction . more than 50 % of wetlands in the u.s. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years . between 60 % and 70 % of european wetlands have been completely destroyed . in the united kingdom , there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years . the rising sea levels and temperatures has caused soil erosion , coastal flooding , and loss of quality in the uk marine ecosystem . about one - fifth ( 20 % ) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans . one - fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed , and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing , pollution , and invasive species ; 90 % of the philippines \\' coral reefs alone have been destroyed . finally , over 35 % mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed . </p> <h2> natural causes ( edit ) </h2> <p> habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism , fire , and climate change is well documented in the fossil record . one study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity , but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles . </p> <h2> human causes ( edit ) </h2> deforestation and roads in amazonia , the amazon rainforest . <p> habitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests , etc. to arable land , urban sprawl , infrastructure development , and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land . habitat degradation , fragmentation , and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat , yet result in habitat collapse . desertification , deforestation , and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ( deserts , forests , coral reefs ) . </p> <p> geist and lambin ( 2002 ) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation . their results , yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor , provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant . the proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion ( 96 % ) , infrastructure expansion ( 72 % ) , and wood extraction ( 67 % ) . therefore , according to this study , forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation . the specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation : transport extension ( 64 % ) , commercial wood extraction ( 52 % ) , permanent cultivation ( 48 % ) , cattle ranching ( 46 % ) , shifting ( slash and burn ) cultivation ( 41 % ) , subsistence agriculture ( 40 % ) , and fuel wood extraction for domestic use ( 28 % ) . one result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions , while transport extension ( including the construction of new roads ) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation . </p> <h3> global warming ( edit ) </h3> <p> rising global temperatures , caused by the greenhouse effect , contribute to habitat destruction , endangering various species , such as the polar bear . melting ice caps promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally . </p> <h2> drivers ( edit ) </h2> nanjing road in shanghai <p> while the above - mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat , this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat . the forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as drivers of habitat destruction . demographic , economic , sociopolitical , scientific and technological , and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction . </p> <p> demographic drivers include the expanding human population ; rate of population increase over time ; spatial distribution of people in a given area ( urban versus rural ) , ecosystem type , and country ; and the combined effects of poverty , age , family planning , gender , and education status of people in certain areas . most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots . this may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9 % of the variation in numbers of threatened species across 114 countries , providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity . the boom in human population and migration of people into such species - rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests . the high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people , most of whom lacking an education and family planning . </p> <p> from the geist and lambin ( 2002 ) study described in the previous section , the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows ( with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in ) : economic factors ( 81 % ) , institutional or policy factors ( 78 % ) , technological factors ( 70 % ) , cultural or socio - political factors ( 66 % ) , and demographic factors ( 61 % ) . the main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets ( 68 % ) , which are driven by national and international demands ; urban industrial growth ( 38 % ) ; low domestic costs for land , labor , fuel , and timber ( 32 % ) ; and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops ( 25 % ) . institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development ( 40 % ) , economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement ( 34 % ) , and subsidies for land - based activities ( 26 % ) ; property rights and land - tenure insecurity ( 44 % ) ; and policy failures such as corruption , lawlessness , or mismanagement ( 42 % ) . the main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry ( 45 % ) , which leads to wasteful logging practices . within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values ( 63 % ) , individual / household behavior ( 53 % ) , public unconcern toward forest environments ( 43 % ) , missing basic values ( 36 % ) , and unconcern by individuals ( 32 % ) . demographic factors were the in - migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas ( 38 % ) and growing population density -- a result of the first factor -- in those areas ( 25 % ) . </p> <p> there are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process . road construction has the largest feedback effect , because it interacts with -- and leads to -- the establishment of new settlements and more people , which causes a growth in wood ( logging ) and food markets . growth in these markets , in turn , progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries . when these industries become commercialized , they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often are worse on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods . either way , more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets . this common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other . </p> <h2> impact on human population ( edit ) </h2> the draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the gulf coast contributed to severe flooding in new orleans , louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane katrina . <p> habitat destruction vastly increases an area \\'s vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought , crop failure , spread of disease , and water contamination . on the other hand , a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening , or will at least mitigate adverse impacts . </p> <p> agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape . over the past 50 years , the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40 % of agricultural land worldwide via erosion , salinization , compaction , nutrient depletion , pollution , and urbanization . humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed . aesthetic uses such as birdwatching , recreational uses like hunting and fishing , and ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat . many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide . </p> <p> probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services . habitat destruction has altered nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur , and carbon cycles , which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain , algal blooms , and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change . one ecosystem service whose significance is becoming more realized is climate regulation . on a local scale , trees provide windbreaks and shade ; on a regional scale , plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall ; on a global scale , plants ( especially trees from tropical rainforests ) from around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis . other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management , nitrogen fixation , oxygen production , pollination ( see pollinator decline ) , waste treatment ( i.e. , the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants ) , and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff . </p> <p> the loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth \\'s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide . these services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change . </p> <p> the loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans , but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous . when biodiversity is lost , the environment loses many species that provide valuable and unique roles to the ecosystem . the environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions . when too much biodiversity is lost , a catastrophic event such as an earthquake , flood , or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash , and humans would obviously suffer from that . loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher - yielding crop varieties , pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer , and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide - resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi , viruses , and bacteria . </p> <p> the negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations . across the globe , poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed , because less natural habitat means less natural resources per capita , yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources . </p> <p> another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of keeping an area undisturbed . in other words , what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat ? a country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row - crop agriculture , but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water , timber , ecotourism , or flood regulation and drought control . </p> <h2> outlook ( edit ) </h2> <p> the rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the world \\'s food requirement substantially . simple logic instructs that more people will require more food . in fact , as the world \\'s population increases dramatically , agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50 % , over the next 30 years . in the past , continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to appease the global food demand . that easy fix will no longer be available , however , as more than 98 % of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair . </p> <p> the impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction . commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land , so they will use more fertilizers and less concern for the environment to meet the market demand . others will seek out new land or will convert other land - uses to agriculture . agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants . species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation , degradation , or pollution . any efforts to protect the world \\'s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans \\' growing demand for natural resources , especially new agricultural lands . </p> <h2> solutions ( edit ) </h2> chelonia mydas on a hawaiian coral reef . although the endangered species is protected , habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of green turtle nesting beaches . <p> in most cases of tropical deforestation , three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes . this means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country . before any local , national , or international deforestation policies are written and enforced , governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country . this concept , along with many other results about tropical deforestation from the geist and lambin study , can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general . governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces , rather than merely regulating the proximate causes . in a broader sense , governmental bodies at a local , national , and international scale need to emphasize the following : </p> <ol> <li> considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats . </li> <li> protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat . </li> <li> educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity . </li> <li> developing family planning programs in areas of rapid population growth . </li> <li> finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production . </li> <li> preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats . </li> <li> reduce human population and expansion . </li> </ol> <h2> notes ( edit ) </h2> <ol> <li> ^ jump up to : sahney , s. , benton , m.j. & falcon -
